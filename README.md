# HPC-Webinar

## Prerequisites

Before you start running any of the demo. You need to install mpich in your system.
```console
foo@bar:~$ sudo apt install mpich
```
### Things to Note

* These examples will work fine if you are running on single machine.
* For multiple machines, keep your host file updated.
* If your machines are not on the Intranet, /etc/hosts files needs to be modified, since MPI looks for the hostnames. For that, a sample script has been provided.
* MPI programs are hard to debug. Since, error can be generated by any one of the processes which makes it hard to track.
* Debuggers are available but are complicated to run. (I will attach a link if I will come accros a simple one)

## Program List
